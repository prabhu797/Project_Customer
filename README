Hello,
Thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity. I really enjoyed working on the project. Although I am well versed in Java, spring boot, hibernate and my SQL, my Javascript also proves to be strong and I have successfully completed the application. 

This application will allow user to login, create customer, edit customer details and delete customer details. 


<-------------------- How to use --------------------> 
1. If you are trying to access the page aur api then please make the below changes.
	Please change the "const cors = "http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/";" to "const cors = "";".
   Else if you are using localhost then don't make any changes.
2. Please launch index.html from login folder, subsequently you will be able to reach or access all other pages.


To conclude, I believe I have completed the assignment up to your expectations and I look forward to joining the company and working more on such projects. 

Hope to hear from you at the earliest. Kindly do the needful.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Prabhudev Desai.
